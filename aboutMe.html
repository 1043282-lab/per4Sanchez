  <h2>Little bit about me&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

 <div> <p>Hi, my name is Robert. I am currently a senior at El Camino High School, and being in my last year of high school feels like an exciting but also pretty surreal stage of life. Over the years I’ve grown a lot academically and personally, and now I’m really looking forward to what comes next after graduation, whether that’s college, work opportunities, or simply new experiences that will push me to grow even more.
When I’m not busy with school or work, I like to make the most of my free time by doing things that keep me active and allow me to relax at the same time. One of my favorite hobbies is playing frisbee, whether it’s casually with friends at the park or just tossing it around on a sunny afternoon. There’s something about the game that makes it both competitive and fun, and I enjoy the teamwork and energy that comes with it.
I also love going on drives. For me, driving isn’t just about getting from one place to another—it’s a way to clear my head, listen to music, and enjoy a sense of independence. Sometimes I’ll take longer drives just to explore new areas or to unwind after a long day.
Another activity I really enjoy is going to the pool. Swimming or just hanging out by the water gives me a chance to relax, cool off, and spend time with people I care about. It’s a great way to break away from the stress of school and work while also staying active and healthy.
Of course, one of the most important parts of my free time is hanging out with my friends. Whether we’re at the pool, driving around, or just sitting and talking, being with them is what makes a lot of my days memorable. Friends keep things exciting, bring me laughs, and help me get through challenges.
Altogether, I’d say that I try to live a balanced life—focusing on school and responsibilities while also making time for hobbies and people who matter to me. Senior year is a big deal, and I’m glad I get to spend it doing the things I enjoy</p> </div>
